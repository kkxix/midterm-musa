# Policy Context

---

## Evictions are High in Philadelphia

:::{.incremental}
- There have been ***11,166*** eviction filings in Philadelphia so far in 2025.
- Over the past 12 months the eviction filing rate has been ***4%***.

## Eviction Filings vs Judgements

:::{.incremental}
- The legal process of eviction involves going to the Municipal Court, filing an eviction, a hearing is scheduled, and eventually a judgement is made. 
- A lot of filings (about half in our dataset) are settled outside of court between the landlord and tenant
- The vast majority of filings that go on to a court judgement end up ruling in the landlord's favor

# Problem Statement

---

## Can we predict the number of eviction filings that will lead to judgments per census tract in Philadelphia?

:::{.incremental}
- If a is more likely to lead to a judgement it signifies areas where landlords are less willing to negotiate with a tenant outside of court
- The tenant is more likely for the outcome to not be in their favor
- Thus more resources and regulations should target those areas

## Related Questions:

- What are the characteristics of the census tracts with the highest share of judgements / filings? 
- How can the city better protect renters in these high risk areas?

# Data Sources

- We use observed and validated eviction filing and judgement data by Philadelphia census tract from [Eviction Lab](https://data-downloads.evictionlab.org/#data-for-analysis/). Data is only available for 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016. 
- ACS 2016 5-Year Data
- Property Sales (2023-2024) - Office of Property Assessment

# Our Model: Binomial Regression

---

## Given a filing, what is the probability of judgement? --> Binary outcome (judgement or no judgement)

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
binomial_group_model <- glm(cbind(judgments, filings - judgments) ~ category_code_description + median_year_built + total_livable_area + factor(year) + rent_burden_rate + median_h_incomeE + familiesE + black_percent + total_pop,
                         family = binomial,
                         data = model_data)
```

---

## Key Significant Variables

- ***Dependant Variable***: `(judgments, filings - judgments)` allows us to weight probability of judgement by number of filings in census tract.
- ***Demographics***: Rent burden, median household income, number of families, percent of balck residents, total population.
- ***Housing Type***: We used the most common property type per tract by category code, median year built, and total livable area.

## Cross Validation

- Train on 2010, 2011, 2012
- Test on 2016

# Results

## Mean Absolute Error 

- Convert probability into actual predicted judgements: 

`test_data$predicted_judgments <- test_data$filings * test_data$predicted_prob_judgment`

- **MAE: 6.4** 
- On average, we predict 6 judements wrong based on the number of filings

## Map of Absolute Error

Errors are evenly distributed, however there are some extreme outliers

<div style="transform: scale(0.8); transform-origin: top left;">

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">5 Highest Error Tracts, 2016</p>

| Filings | Judgements | Judgements:Filings | Rent Burden | Median Household Income | Percent Black | Absolute Error |

| 524 | 67 | 13% | 41% | 19k | 63% | 172 |

Compared to Overall Philadelphia, 2016 stats:

<br><br>

<div style="transform: scale(0.8); transform-origin: top left;">

<p style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold;">Philadelphia, 2016</p>

| Filings | Judgements | Judgements:Filings | Rent Burden | Median Household Income | Percent Black |
|------------|-----------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| 21,769 | 10,234 | 47% | 51% | 11k - 145k | 43% |

</div>

The high-error tracts have a much lower judgement rate, a low median income, and are majority Black

# Limitations and Bias Considerations

---

:::{.incremental}
- Major policy change since 2016, need more up-to-date data
- 
:::

---

# Recommendations for Implementation

---

:::{.incremental}
1. Monitor large landlords in high risk areas 
2. Dedicate rental assistance programs to high risk areas
3. Dedicate legal aid resources to higher judgement-liklihood areas
