# Our Goal
Develop a predictive model that:

-   Accurately estimates home values in Philadelphia
-   Reflects the spatial, structural, and cultural characteristics in the city
-   Streamlines processes for the Office of Property Assessment

# Data Sources
-   Property Sales (2023-2024) - Office of Property Assessment
-   Demographics (2023) - American Community Survey 5-Year Data

# Spatial Features Explored
-   Farmer's Markets - OpenDataPhilly (Department of Public Health)
-   Hospitals - OpenDataPhilly (Department of Public Health)
-   Landmarks - OpenDataPhilly (Office of Innovation and Technology)
-   Park Properties - OpenDataPhilly (Philadelphia Parks and Recreation)
-   Schools - OpenDataPhilly (Department of Planning and Development)

# Comparing Models
| Model | RMSE | RÂ² | MAE |
|:--|--:|--:|--:|
| Structural | 0.73 | 0.24 | 0.52 |
| + Census | 0.53 | 0.61 | 0.37 |
| + Spatial | 0.52 | 0.62 | 0.36 |
| + Fixed Effects | **0.50** | **0.65** | **0.34** |

RMSE = ~$162,500

Each added feature layer improves predictions.

# Top Predictors
-   Median Household Income
-   Total Liveable Area
-   Proximity to Hospitals, Schools, and Farmer's Markets

# Residuals by Location

# Recommendations
-   Integrate spatial and census data into the City's AVM
-   Reassess neighborhoods regularly to account for gentrification

# Limitations & Next Steps
**Limitations:** data gaps, time

**Next Steps:** add more spatial variables
