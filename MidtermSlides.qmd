# Our Goal

Develop a predictive model that:

-   Accurately estimates home values in Philadelphia
-   Reflects the spatial, structural, and cultural characteristics in the city
-   Streamlines processes for the Office of Property Assessment

# Home Prices in PHL

# Analyzing a Reason

# Data Sources

-   Property Sales (2023-2024) - Office of Property Assessment
-   Demographics (2023) - American Community Survey 5-Year Data

# Spatial Features Explored

-   Farmer's Markets - OpenDataPhilly (Department of Public Health)
-   Hospitals - OpenDataPhilly (Department of Public Health)
-   Landmarks - OpenDataPhilly (Office of Innovation and Technology)
-   Park Properties - OpenDataPhilly (Philadelphia Parks and Recreation)
-   Schools - OpenDataPhilly (Department of Planning and Development)

# Comparing Models

| Model            |     RMSE |       R² |      MAE |
|:-----------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Structural       |     0.73 |     0.24 |     0.52 |
| \+ Census        |     0.53 |     0.61 |     0.37 |
| \+ Spatial       |     0.52 |     0.62 |     0.36 |
| \+ Fixed Effects | **0.50** | **0.65** | **0.34** |

RMSE = \~\$162,500

Each added feature layer improves predictions.

# Top Predictors

-   Median Household Income
-   Total Liveable Area
-   Proximity to Hospitals, Schools, and Farmer's Markets

# Residuals by Location

# Recommendations

-   Integrate spatial and census data into the City's AVM
-   Reassess neighborhoods regularly to account for gentrification

# Limitations & Next Steps

**Limitations:** data gaps, time

**Next Steps:** add more spatial variables
